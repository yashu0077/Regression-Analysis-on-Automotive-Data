ðŸ‘‹ Hello folks! Welcome to this exciting mini-project on Car Price Prediction!

In this project, we take a real-world dataset and walk through the entire Machine Learning pipeline â€” from data exploration to building regression models and improving results.

We begin with EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) to understand how different features like engine size, horsepower, and mileage affect car prices. Then, we dive into data preprocessing, cleaning the data and preparing it for modeling.

We first apply Multiple Linear Regression to make predictions. But we didnâ€™t stop there! To improve our results, we used Polynomial Regression, which helped us better capture non-linear patterns and achieve lower error rates and a more accurate model.

The project is built on the Car Price dataset, and everything is done using Python and popular libraries like pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, and scikit-learn.

Hope you enjoy the journey! ðŸš—ðŸ“Šâœ¨
